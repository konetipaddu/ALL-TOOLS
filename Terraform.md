## What is Terraform?
      Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as a code tool created by HashiCorp, that lets you provision, build, change, and version cloud and on-prem resources. It lets you define both Cloud and on-prem resources in human-readable configuration files that you can version, reuse, and share.

## What is Infrastructure as Code?
      Infrastructure as code (IaC) is the process that allows you to manage infrastructure with configuration files rather than through a graphical user interface. IaaC allows you to build, change, and manage your infrastructure in a safe, consistent, and repeatable way by defining resource configurations that you can version, reuse, and share.

## Why Terraform?
       * Manage any Infrastructure
       * Track Infrastructure
       * Reduce time to provision
       * Support multi-cloud Infrastructure deployment
       * Automate changes
       * Standardize configuration
       * Collaboration

## How does Terraform work?
       Terraform creates and manages resources on a cloud platform and other services through their APIs. Providers enable Terraform to work with virtually any platform or service with an accessible API.
       
       Providers are a logical abstraction of an upstream API. They are responsible for understanding API interactions and exposing resources. Providers supported by Terraform, there are officially 130 providers supported by Terraform:
       
          * AWS
          * Azure
          * Google Cloud Platform
          * Kubernetes and so on
